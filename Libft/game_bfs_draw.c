	What are we doing here?

	-	At the end of the bfs process, every enemy will se
		something like this:

		-REAL MAP-			-WHAT ENEMIES SEE-

		111111111				000000000
		10$000011				01$123400
		100111001				021000560
		1000P0001				0345P7670
		111111111				000000000

	-	Actually, they can't recognize P and $.
		We need to tell them where they are.
	-	For everything else, this is what they see.
	-	What represents the numbers?
	-	The distances from the enemy, calculated with bfs.
	-	The zeroes are walls, or other unpassable objects.
	-	What we need to do now, is draw a clear path to the
		player. Every enemy has its own map to do so.
	-	In short words, we need to do this: 

		-FINAL PATH-

		000000000
		011000000
		010000000
		011110000
		000000000

	-	How do we do this?
	-	Simple: we need to find the littlest number
		from the player.
	-	In our example is 5: then we go to 5.
	-	Next, we have 4, and so on.
	-	We need to mark every number we want.
	-	We mark them with this formula: (n_enemy + 1) * -1.
	-	But, actually, we don't care how it is marked.
	-	What is important is that the enemy sees only two
		symbols: where it needs to go, and where it mustn't.
	-	After have marked the path (with negative numbers), 
		we set to zero every positive number.
	-	In this way, they'll just see the marks and the zeros.

	-	What happens if there is no valid path?
	-	It means that around player there is nothing 
		different from zeros.
	-	Then, we can just simply call the function that clears
		what enemy sees.
